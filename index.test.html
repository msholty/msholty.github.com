					<p>
						Whey protein is one of the two proteins found in Milk, with the
						other being <a href="/supplements/Casein+Protein/" rel="popover"
							data-content="Out of the 'curds and the whey' of milk, Casein protein is the curds. A dietary protein source with gel-forming capabilities, it is touted to be slowly absorbed in part due to slowing intestinal motility (opioid agonism) and forming gels like fiber; adding water makes pudding"
							data-original-title="Casein Protein">casein</a>. When a coagulant
						(usually renin) is added to milk, the curds and the wheys form
						(solid and liquids) with the curds being casein and the wheys
						being whey. Whey protein is the water-soluble portion of milk, and
						is comprised of various water-soluble amino acids and protein
						structures as well as anything else lost in this portion.
					</p>

					<p>Although many benefits associated with Whey protein are due
						to it being a protein itself (and thus could be extended to many
						protein sources), Whey appears unique in the sense that it
						delivers a large amount of the amino acid L-Cysteine. A
						subclinical deficiency state of L-Cysteine may exist during aging
						and diabetes (as well as some other conditions) that can be
						alleviated with additional dietary L-Cysteine; either a surplus of
						protein in general or more efficiently through Whey protein due to
						more Cysteine per gram of protein.</p>

					<p>Whey is touted at being faster absorbed than other forms of
						protein, and this is demonstrably true. However, this increased
						speed does not seem to transfer well to increased Muscle Protein
						Synthesis when the body is already in a fed state. Whey may be
						better than other protein sources at inducing protein synthesis in
						a fasted state (first meal of the day), but does not seem to be
						significantly better when protein is added to a long-term exercise
						regimen. Beyond breaking a fasted state, preferably when exercise
						was also done, the increased speed of whey protein does not appear
						to confer much practical benefit (despite theoretically being able
						to).</p>

					<p>
						Whey is also touted to increase fat loss, but this appears to be a
						function of protein <em>per se</em> rather than whey and is not
						like a classical fat loss agent (Whey can make fat loss go more
						smoothly, but does not inherently reduce fat; requiring a caloric
						deficit). The efficiency aspect of whey does play a role, with
						Whey being a better protein choice for preserving <a

						intakes, other sources such as soy seem equally effective as whey

					<p>Like all other protein sources, whey does not inherently
						harm the liver or kidneys, but it can exacerbate pre-existing
						damage. Persons with harmed livers or kidneys (disease states or
						otherwise) should exercise caution in increasing protein intake
						too quickly and without the guidance of a medical doctor.</p>

						<p>I just want to note two things to help disambiguate this

						<ul class="listing">
							<li><p>
									Studies done on whey protein in a 'double blind manner' are
									less than perfect, as the placebo group has to be glucose or
									some inert form of calories. Calories can act in the body <b>per
										se</b>, so a true control group isn't feasible with protein
									supplementation; it is more like an assortment of blinded
									comparison studies where both must be seen as bioactive even
									without the placebo effect
								</p></li>
							<li><p>Masking is problematic, since you tend to drink
									whey protein and cannot just pop pills; a lot of otherwise well
									conducted studies might be getting C ratings in the table due
									to lack of feasible blinding</p></li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							But beyond that, please take note of the 'Comparison to Other
							Protein sources' section; it helps to show what benefits <em>whey</em>
							(per se) has over other protein soruces, since protein itself can
							give much benefit

							data-original-title="Casein Protein">casein</a>. Whereas casein
						consists of approximately 70-80% of bovine protein, whey protein

						the two fragments separate after a coagulant is added). Whey is
						the liquid portion that is seen as 'by-product' from the process
						of making cheese that consists of mostly caseins, and the
						technical definition of the whey is "the group of milk proteins
						that remain soluble in milk serum or whey after precipitation of
						CN at pH 4.6 and 20°C".<sup><a href="#ref25">[25]</a></sup> Thus
						'Whey' is not one protein but a class of proteins grouped
						collectively based on their solubility and production method.
					</p>

					<p>
						Whey can be found in milk <em>in general</em>. Although the
						majority of commercially sold whey is derived from cows (bovine
						whey), whey can also be derived via any animal that produces milk
						through breast tissues: buffalo,<sup><a href="#ref26">[26]</a></sup>
						camels,<sup><a href="#ref27">[27]</a></sup> llamas,<sup><a

						and humans<sup><a href="#ref30">[30]</a></sup> to name a few.
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						When milk is met with a coagulating agent, the part that
						coagulates is cheese; the part that does not (liquid part) are the

					<h4>1.2. Composition (Peptides)</h4>
					<p></p>

					<p>The amino acids in whey protein can be formed into different
						orders, and create unique bioactive peptides. Beyond differences
						in amino acid composition, different protein sources can have
						different effects through their bioactive peptides. The peptides
						in whey are the following, and the four (4) bolded peptides are
						those with most practical relevance (due to their high contents in
						whey).</p>

					<h4>2.1. L-Cysteine and Glutathione</h4>
					<p></p>

					<p>Glutathione is an endogenous (made and stored in the body)
						anti-oxidant enzyme that is made of amino acids, with L-Cysteine
						being the rate-limiting enzyme.</p>

					<p>
						Populations that may be deficient in glutathione levels and show
						promise with either whey or isolated L-Cysteine supplementation
						include cancer patients,<sup><a href="#ref54">[54]</a></sup> HIV
						infection,<sup><a href="#ref55">[55]</a></sup><sup><a
							href="#ref56">[56]</a></sup> and aging (which reduces synthesis of
						glutathione, and can be reversed with L-Cysteine).<sup><a
							href="#ref57">[57]</a></sup> Increased glutathione via whey protein
						supplementation has been associated with longevity in at least one
						study in mice, where Whey outperformed casein and promoted
						survival.<sup><a href="#ref58">[58]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						Some other conditions that are characterized by oxidative stress,
						but not specifically a glutathione deficiency, may also be
						implicated. These include Cystic Fibrosis<sup><a
							href="#ref59">[59]</a></sup> of which supplementation of whey can
						increase glutathione stores.<sup><a href="#ref60">[60]</a></sup><sup><a
							href="#ref61">[61]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						Glutathione stores can be increased in otherwise healthy persons,
						with whey protein (in this study, pressurized whey) increasing
						glutathione by up to 24% in 2 weeks with approximately 2 regular
						scoops (45g) of protein daily.<sup><a href="#ref62">[62]</a></sup>
						This increase is additive with the increase seen with resistance
						training.<sup><a href="#ref19">[19]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						Whey can be a convenient and cheap vessel of dietary L-Cysteine,
						which can be elevated to vitamin-like importance in certain
						conditions of oxidative stress. A cysteine deficiency is not
						universally recognized due to it being an non-essential amino acid

					<h4>2.2. L-Cysteine and Hydrogen Sulfide</h4>
					<p></p>

					<p>
						Hydrogen Sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is a gaseous byproduct
						(frequently remarked to be the causative smell of eggs<sup><a
							href="#ref63">[63]</a></sup>) that appears to act as a signalling
						molecule, similar to <a href="/topics/Nitric+Oxide/" rel="popover"
							data-content="Nitric Oxide is a signalling molecule formed from Nitrogen (N) and Oxygen (O) and simply called NO. It induces pro-oxidative changes, and is mostly implicated (positively) in blood pressure, erections, muscle, and Immunology"
							data-original-title="Nitric Oxide">Nitric Oxide</a> in the sense
						that it promotes vasorelaxation of blood vessels (although the
						mechanism is by stimulating K<sub>ATP</sub> channels<sup><a
							href="#ref64">[64]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref65">[65]</a></sup>) and
						has anti-oxidative capabilities. A circulating H<sub>2</sub>S pool
						of 10-100uM exists in the human body<sup><a href="#ref66">[66]</a></sup><sup><a
							href="#ref67">[67]</a></sup> although higher (130uM) has been reported
						in healthy persons.<sup><a href="#ref68">[68]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						H<sub>2</sub>S is produced endogenously mainly by the action of
						two enzymes, cystathionine-ß-synthase and cystathionine-?-lyase.<sup><a
							href="#ref65">[65]</a></sup> The former enzyme
						(cystathionine-ß-synthase) is highly localized to the central and
						peripheral nervous system while the latter is expressed in the
						thoracic aorta, portal vein, ileum, heart, liver, kidney, and
						vascular smooth muscle.<sup><a href="#ref65">[65]</a></sup><sup><a
							href="#ref67">[67]</a></sup> Two other enzymes may also contribute to a
						circulating H<sub>2</sub>S pool, namely 3-mercaptopyruvate
						sulfurtransferase and cysteine aminotransferase, both of which are
						active in the brain and the endothelium.<sup><a
							href="#ref69">[69]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref70">[70]</a></sup><sup><a
							href="#ref71">[71]</a></sup> Abolishing cystathionine-?-lyase and
						reducing the circulating H<sub>2</sub>S pool induce hypertension
						in rats and reduce the abilities of the blood vessels to respond
						to vasorelaxation<sup><a href="#ref67">[67]</a></sup> as well as
						increasing homocysteine levels, indicative of heart and
						neurovascular diseases.<sup><a href="#ref72">[72]</a></sup>
						Conversely, adding in a H<sub>2</sub>S donor to increase
						circulating levels can, in ApoE deficient mice, reduce
						artherosclerotic build-up and promotes blood flow.<sup><a
							href="#ref73">[73]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						At the outset, H<sub>2</sub>S (Hydrogen Sulfide) appears to be a
						heart healthy (cardioprotective) signalling molecule that is
						derived from a circulating Cysteine pool; Cysteine remains in
						storage in the body, and serves to buffer a pool of H<sub>2</sub>S
						that preserves physiological functions<br>
					</blockquote>

					<p>
						Circulating Hydrogen sulfide levels appear to be lower in Type II
						Diabetics (110uM) relative to age-matched non-diabetic controls
						(130uM) when weight was not measured,<sup><a href="#ref68">[68]</a></sup>
						and are lower in non-diabetic obese persons relative to
						non-diabetic lean persons.<sup><a href="#ref74">[74]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						Theoretically, maintaining a sufficient Cysteine pool should be
						cardioprotective; some populations appear to be lower in H<sub>2</sub>S
						but no evidence currently exists that supplementing Cystine in
						these populations can increase H<sub>2</sub>S<br>

					<p>
						<span id="summary3-0"></span>
					</p>
					<h4>3.1. Whey Concentrate</h4>
					<p></p>

					<p>
						Concentrate is the least processed form, and is 35-80% protein by
						weight.<sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup> The wide range is
						applicable to all whey, as some is used in food products as well;
						supplemental whey protein concentrate is referred to as WPC 80 and
						tends to be standardized at 80% protein by weight.
					</p>

					<p>
						<span id="summary3-1"></span>
					</p>
					<h4>3.2. Whey Isolate</h4>
					<p></p>

					<p>
						Isolate is defined as being more than 90% protein by weight.<sup><a
							href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						<span id="summary3-2"></span>
					</p>
					<h4>3.3. Whey Hydrolysate</h4>
					<p></p>

					<p>
						Hydrolysate is protein that is enzymatically and acid pretreated
						to reduce the particulate size even further and is the fastest
						absorbed. Hydrolyzed protein is protein that cleaves peptide
						bonds, and reduces large quaternary proteins down to peptides and
						free amino acids. Due to this, special bioactive effects of
						quaternary protein structures in whey (immunoglobulins, bovine
						serum albumin, lactalglobulin and lactalbumins) <em>may</em> not
						apply to hydrolyzed whey, depending on the di- and tripeptides
						left over.<sup><a href="#ref75">[75]</a></sup> An excess of free
						amino acids, particularly the <a

							data-original-title="Branched Chain Amino Acids">Branched
							Chain Amino Acids</a> and Proline (the latter more of a concern to
						casein hydrolysate) can produce a large adverse bitter taste.
					</p>

					<p>
						The process of hydrolyzation can reduce the allergic potential of
						whey and milk protein, due to removing allergenic epitopes; a
						reason for the usage of hydrolyzed proteins in infant formula<sup><a
							href="#ref75">[75]</a></sup> which, according to meta-analysis and
						systemic reviews, is effective in reducing the occurrence of
						atopic dermatitis (an inflammatory condition) when compared
						against cows milk; although breast milk for infants is still
						advised.<sup><a href="#ref76">[76]</a></sup><sup><a
							href="#ref77">[77]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref78">[78]</a></sup>
						Hydrolysis, even partially, can improve the solubility and improve
						<em>in vitro</em> digestability.<sup><a href="#ref49">[49]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						In a study comparing the effects of whey protein hydrolysate to <a
							href="/supplements/Casein+Protein/" rel="popover"
							data-content="Out of the 'curds and the whey' of milk, Casein protein is the curds. A dietary protein source with gel-forming capabilities, it is touted to be slowly absorbed in part due to slowing intestinal motility (opioid agonism) and forming gels like fiber; adding water makes pudding"
							data-original-title="Casein Protein">casein</a> hydrolysate (a
						fast absorbed form of casein), whey protein resulted in more
						muscle protein synthesis over 8 hours after 20g in older
						individuals (74+/-1yrs) at rest.<sup><a href="#ref79">[79]</a></sup>
						Whey hydrolysate had a mixed fractional protein synthesis rate of
						0.15+/-0.02%, while casein hydrolysate and regular casein had
						0.10+/-0.01% and 0.08+/-0.01% respectively.<sup><a
							href="#ref79">[79]</a></sup> A correlation (r=0.55) was noted with
						plasma C<sub>max</sub> values of essential amino acids, and a
						slightly higher correlation (r=0.66) with <a

							data-content="Leucine is the main BCAA, and is the BCAA where most benefit is given to. Supplementing Leucine on its own is still beneficial and may be cheaper than BCAA mixes; they all still taste bitter, however"
							data-original-title="Leucine">Leucine</a> in particular.<sup><a
							href="#ref79">[79]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						In instances where a faster protein source is desired (perhaps
						pre-fuel for fasted training, or protein synthesis in the
						elderly), then a hydrolyzed whey protein may confer additional
						benefits when compared to a whey concentrate. They have either
						equal health benefits, or hydrolysate may confer less (or at least
						different) health benefits due to breaking of large peptides prior
						to digestion<br>
					</blockquote>

					<p>
						One study that gave participants Whey Isolate or Whey Hydrolysate
						and tested performance at baseline and then 6 hours later noted
						that only the Hydrolysate group recovered power in such a short
						time frame, although no differences existed in muscle soreness.<sup><a
							href="#ref80">[80]</a></sup> Protein in general appears to enhance
						recovery, but most studies are done on subsequent days; this
						suggests Hydrolyzed Whey may be of benefit to two-a-day workouts.

						<span id="summary3-3"></span>
					</p>
					<h4>3.4. Ultrafiltration</h4>
					<p></p>

					<p>
						Ultrafiltration is another filtration through a physical gradient,
						where whey passes through and smaller compounds are allowed to
						pass and larger molecules get caught.<sup><a href="#ref81">[81]</a></sup>
						Standard ultrafiltration uses a transmembrane pressure (pressure
						used to 'push' molecules through the gradient) of 275kPa and tend
						to use polyethersulfone barriers, which allows molecules of
						5-10kDA to pass.<sup><a href="#ref82">[82]</a></sup> Bovine Serum
						Albumin, a-lactalbumin, and ß-lactoglobulin are significantly
						larger than this and excluded, while most immunoglobulins are
						closer but still above this threshold. Exclusion of a-lactalbumin
						in the whey is actually a cost-effective way of isolating
						a-lactalbumin for usage in infant formulas, research, or for
						fortification purposes.<sup><a href="#ref82">[82]</a></sup><sup><a
							href="#ref83">[83]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						When Whey Concentrate is subject to ultrafiltration, the amount of
						vitamins per gram of protein increases slightly relative to the
						whey it was derived from. Amino acid ratios remain the same, but
						are much higher per gram of product due to the act of
						concentration. Mineral and ash content are reduced.<sup><a
							href="#ref84">[84]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						<span id="summary3-4"></span>
					</p>
					<h4>3.5. Microfiltration</h4>
					<p></p>

					<p>
						Microfiltration is the same process of ultrafiltration, but with a
						more restrictive gradient. Rather than a polyethersulfone barrier,
						microfiltration tends to use a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)
						membrane which allows molecules between 0.1-0.5uM through, a more
						restrictive membrane relative to ultrafiltration.<sup><a

					<h4>4.1. Stomach Digestion</h4>
					<p></p>

					<p>
						Whey appears to resist coagulation in the stomach and pass on
						relatively quickly to the intestines.<sup><a href="#ref35">[35]</a></sup>
						This is notable due to casein proteins (the other component of
						milk) emptying slower from the stomach,<sup><a href="#ref85">[85]</a></sup>
						via precipitation in an acidic medium which slows gastric passage
						due to the solid inducing a duodenal 'lag phase'.<sup><a
							href="#ref86">[86]</a></sup> Interestingly, enzymes found inherently in
						milk (Alkaline Phosphatase) can dephosphorylize casein and enhance
						solubility and gastric passage.<sup><a href="#ref87">[87]</a></sup><sup><a
							href="#ref88">[88]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						When measuring beta-lactalbumin (largest component of whey) in the
						intestines, this specific component does not appear to be subject
						to much hydrolysis in the stomach as it appears intact in the
						intestines.<sup><a href="#ref89">[89]</a></sup> Due to lack of
						hydrolysis inherently, there do not appear to be many differences
						in gastric emptying time between Whey Isolate and Whey
						Hydrolysate, when consumed at 45g under fasted conditions in
						healthy males.<sup><a href="#ref90">[90]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						A general rule of thumb is that whey is emptied from the stomach
						faster than <a href="/supplements/Casein+Protein/" rel="popover"

						was able to reduce liver enzymes (ALT down from 64.89U/L to

						deposits while improving glutathione (an endogenous anti-oxidant
						enzyme) status.<sup><a href="#ref21">[21]</a></sup> These
						improvements were credited to the Cysteine fragment of Whey
						protein, which has been demonstrated previously in a sample of HIV

						to compare it to (pilot study).<sup><a href="#ref21">[21]</a></sup>
						High doses of whey protein (60g daily) in obese women with high

					<h4>7.3. Kidneys</h4>
					<p></p>

					<p>
						Although not specific to whey, protein in general (and most
						commonly an <em>excess</em> of protein) has been said to cause
						renal (kidney) damage to healthy humans. This claim has been the
						subject of many reviews, and conclusions tend to cluster around
						'no adverse effect of protein' with intakes up to 2.8g/kg
						(1.27g/lb) intake in athletes with higher levels not tested,<sup><a
							href="#ref134">[134]</a></sup> obese persons with normal renal function
						having no apparent harm from a high protein diet for a year,<sup><a
							href="#ref135">[135]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref136">[136]</a></sup>.
						The one study to specifically isolate whey protein is confounded
						with <a href="/supplements/Conjugated+Linoleic+Acid/"
							rel="popover"
							data-content="CLA are fatty acids that acts on a system known as PPAR to induce fat loss. At least, that is what the theory says. CLA too weakly affects PPAR receptors to really induce fat loss in an appreciable amount. TTA appears more promising"

					<p>
						When protein is acutely increased in the diet, glomerular
						filtration rate (a biomarker of renal health) and renal blood flow
						can be increased (in the range of 10-15%) with no apparent harm to
						the kidney<sup><a href="#ref138">[138]</a></sup><sup><a
							href="#ref139">[139]</a></sup> and seems to spike more after acute
						ingestion of animal proteins relative to plant protein.<sup><a
							href="#ref140">[140]</a></sup> Over a longer period of time, glomerular
						filtration rate (GFR) appears to be higher (seen as better) and
						less renal vascular resistance with animal protein than with plant
						protein, with dairy protein (whey) as an intermediate;<sup><a
							href="#ref140">[140]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref141">[141]</a></sup>
						extending this logic shows that vegans and vegetarians have lower
						GFRs than do omnivores, although neither population inherently has
						better or worse renal function (merely reflective of dietary
						protein intake).<sup><a href="#ref142">[142]</a></sup> In general,
						GFR is higher on high protein diets when compared to lower protein
						diets.<sup><a href="#ref143">[143]</a></sup><sup><a
							href="#ref144">[144]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref145">[145]</a></sup><sup><a
							href="#ref142">[142]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						This apparent lack of harm is due to a highly variable excretion
						rate from the kidneys that correlates with dietary intake,<sup><a
							href="#ref144">[144]</a></sup> and these physical adaptations do not
						inherently signal kidney damage.<sup><a href="#ref146">[146]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						In otherwise healthy individuals, and to specify, this section
						refers to those without kidney impairment, protein intake does not
						appear to adversely affect kidney function. There is an apparent
						increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with higher protein
						diets and acute protein ingestion, with an inverse decrease in GFR
						with low protein diets; these fluctuations of GFR are not
						associated with kidney abnormalities if the kidneys were healthy
						to begin with; but signify adaptation to new dietary intake<br>
					</blockquote>

					<p>
						Although there are "no clear renal-related contraindications to HP
						diets in individuals with healthy kidney function",<sup><a
							href="#ref147">[147]</a></sup> protein intakes and whey protein may be
						contraindicted in persons with kidney impairments. The most
						commonly cited is acceleration of chronic kidney disease, where an
						inherent reduction of glomerular filtration rate seen during
						disease pathology (indicative of the failing potential of the
						kidney) appears to be accelerated when dietary protein is raised.<sup><a

						<span id="summary9-0"></span>
					</p>
					<h4>9.1. Immune Cell interactions</h4>
					<p></p>

					<p>
						The two main whey proteins, a-lactalbumin and ß-lactoglobulin,
						appear to enhance innate immunity by enhancing neutrophil
						function.<sup><a href="#ref154">[154]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						Macrophages have been found to have enhanced function via a
						tripeptide of Glycine-Leucine-Phenylalanine derived from
						a-lactalbumin<sup><a href="#ref155">[155]</a></sup> as well as by
						low concentrations of glycomacropeptide (GMP), another component
						of whey.<sup><a href="#ref156">[156]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						An enhanced production of spleen<sup><a href="#ref157">[157]</a></sup>
						and lamina propia<sup><a href="#ref158">[158]</a></sup>
						lymphocytes has been noted with ß-lactoglobulin
					</p>

					<p>
						Lactoperodixase as well as Lactoferrin appear to have suppressive
						actions on lymphocyte proliferation, but these effects are not
						observed in a whey protein concentrate mixture.<sup><a
							href="#ref159">[159]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						Glycomacropeptide has been shown to influence immunity in the
						intestines, exerting anti-inflammatory effects in a rat model of
						colitis.<sup><a href="#ref160">[160]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						<span id="summary9-1"></span>
					</p>
					<h4>9.2. Cytokines</h4>
					<p></p>

					<p>
						Whey protein, relative to cod and gluten protein in obese
						subjects, appears to cause less of a suppression of MCP-1 (a
						cytokine needed for immune cell infiltration of tissues) after a
						meal that is inherently anti-inflammatory; suggesting it may be
						less anti-inflammatory than cod or gluten protein.<sup><a
							href="#ref109">[109]</a></sup> Dairy in general appears to be better at
						suppressing MCP-1 than does soy protein according to a 28-day
						crossover trial in obese adults,<sup><a href="#ref161">[161]</a></sup>
						and this general anti-inflammatory trend of dairy (as assessed by
						cytokines) appears to extend to lean individuals as well, although
						this latter study was not a controlled intervention.<sup><a

						<span id="summary10-0"></span>
					</p>
					<h4>10.1. Glutathione and Oxidation</h4>
					<p></p>

					<p>
						Many of Whey protein's effects with cancer are due to the Cysteine
						rich fragments enhancing Glutathione production.<sup><a
							href="#ref54">[54]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						Interestingly, a study conducted in tumor cells that expressed
						high levels of glutathione (hindering the efficacy of
						chemotherapy) found that 30g of whey protein for 6 months as a
						Cysteine-delivery system in 5 persons with metastatic cancers (7
						persons total) seemed to reduce tumor size in 2 persons (28%),
						stabilize tumor size in two persons, and had no effect on the
						other three.<sup><a href="#ref163">[163]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						<span id="summary10-1"></span>
					</p>
					<h4>10.2. Lactoferrin</h4>
					<p></p>

					<p>
						Lactoferrin is a bioactive peptide with an ability to bind iron,
						and it has been shown to be anti-cancer which may not be related
						to its iron binding properties; that being said, when it becomes
						saturated with iron molecules it can become a potent anti-cancer
						protein<sup><a href="#ref164">[164]</a></sup> and can modulate
						oxidation.<sup><a href="#ref165">[165]</a></sup> <em>In vitro</em>
						studies suggest certain peptides as well, usually lactoferrin, may
						induce cell death in tumor cells and exert cancer-protective
						mechanisms in melanoma cells,<sup><a href="#ref166">[166]</a></sup><sup><a
							href="#ref167">[167]</a></sup> breast cancer cells,<sup><a
							href="#ref44">[44]</a></sup> stomach cancer cells,<sup><a
							href="#ref168">[168]</a></sup> lung cancer cells,<sup><a
							href="#ref169">[169]</a></sup> lymphoma cells,<sup><a
							href="#ref170">[170]</a></sup> and colorectal cancer cells and polyps.<sup><a
							href="#ref171">[171]</a></sup> This last cell line has been shown to be
						effective in humans with isolated bovine lactoferrin at 3g daily,<sup><a
							href="#ref171">[171]</a></sup> establishing its role as a colonic
						anti-tumor agent.<sup><a href="#ref172">[172]</a></sup>
						Translating the 3g bovine lactoferrin used in the aforementioned
						colon cancer study and assuming a 0.5-1.6% lactoferrin content of
						whey, this corresponds to 187.5-600g whey protein (rather high).
					</p>

					<p>
						Lactoferrin appears to be endogenously produced in humans and is
						an aspect of the immune system, while lactoferrin in when (bovine
						lactoferrin) can mimic its actions somewhat.<sup><a
							href="#ref173">[173]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						Although a promising whey-derived anti-cancer molecule, the
						content of lactoferrin in whey may be too low to exert appreciable
						effects<br>
					</blockquote>

					<p>
						<span id="summary10-2"></span>
					</p>
					<h4>10.3. Cachexia</h4>
					<p></p>

					<p>
						Whey protein has been associated with improvements of
						cancer-related cachexia in at least one case study,<sup><a
							href="#ref174">[174]</a></sup> although this case used testosterone
						enanthate at low doses and highly confounds the results. The usage
						of whey in this case was for a surplus of amino acids, and the
						benefit may not be isolated to whey protein <em>per se</em>.<sup><a
							href="#ref174">[174]</a></sup> At least one blinded trial using
						leucine-enriched whey and casein proteins increased protein
						synthesis rate in cancer patients and suggested modifying hospital
						foods may aid in cancer cachexia.<sup><a href="#ref175">[175]</a></sup>

					<p>
						<span id="summary12-0"></span>
					</p>
					<h4>12.1. Myokines and Mechanisms</h4>
					<p></p>

					<p>
						One study comparing whey protein against a non-caloric placebo
						found that whey protein, in middle-aged and older men, was
						associated with an increase in Myostatin binding protein FLRG but
						that a decrease in Myostatin itself was observed only in placebo;
						suggesting that protein intake and exercise influences myostatin
						function.<sup><a href="#ref176">[176]</a></sup> A later study in
						otherwise healthy men also noted that the exercise-induced
						suppression of <a href="/topics/Myostatin/" rel="popover"
							data-content="A stop lever on muscle protein synthesis with no other known roles in the body, abolishing Myostatin in the body results in excessive muscle growth and a reduction of fat mass; the 'holy grail' of bodybuilding due to its potency, supplements targeting Myostatin are lacklustre"
							data-original-title="Myostatin">Myostatin</a> occurred only in
						placebo with whey apparently suppressing this action<sup><a
							href="#ref177">[177]</a></sup> and has been replicated elsewhere.<sup><a
							href="#ref178">[178]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						At least in rats, the increase of Myostatin associated with
						immobility is not suppressed by protein supplementation either.<sup><a
							href="#ref179">[179]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						Counter-intuitively, may prevent the suppression of Myostatin
						induced by exercise relative to control groups; this seems to
						apply to protein in general<br>
					</blockquote>

					<p>
						<span id="summary12-1"></span>
					</p>
					<h4>12.2. Protein Synthesis</h4>
					<p></p>

					<p>
						Pairing protein ingestion and exercise stimulates muscle protein
						synthesis to a greater extent than does ingestion of protein alone
						over the course of 6 hours (measured), suggesting time-dependent
						pairing.<sup><a href="#ref180">[180]</a></sup> One study comparing
						resting protein synthesis rates against protein synthesis rates
						after exercise (same participants and protein content) noted a
						variable increase of 30-100% higher protein uptake into muscle
						tissue when exercise preceded, with protein synthesis being
						291+/-42% higher than baseline when amino acids and exercise were
						paired and 141+/-45% after amino acids only<sup><a
							href="#ref181">[181]</a></sup> (although when comparing isolated amino
						acids, only the essentials seem to be <em>needed</em>)<sup><a
							href="#ref182">[182]</a></sup>. At least one study noted that this
						increased sensitivity of muscle tissue to amino acids can last up
						to 24 hours,<sup><a href="#ref183">[183]</a></sup> so once daily
						exercise can theoretically suffice. In older individuals, some
						damage to the muscle cell (via resistance training) may be needed
						to acheive protein synthesis rates similar to youth, and even then
						at a slightly higher intake of 40g<sup><a href="#ref184">[184]</a></sup>
						to a youth's 20g.<sup><a href="#ref185">[185]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						Many other studies note significantly more muscle protein
						synthesis relative to control, with higher levels of Myofibrillar
						FSR relative to nothing,<sup><a href="#ref8">[8]</a></sup><sup><a
							href="#ref6">[6]</a></sup> higher acute levels of amino acid uptake
						into muscle paired with amino acid retention,<sup><a
							href="#ref5">[5]</a></sup> a higher net nitrogen retention relative to
						a non-intervened group (independent of timing),<sup><a
							href="#ref7">[7]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						Protein is better than nothing when it comes to Muscle Protein
						Synthesis acutely, and Protein's benefits are augmented with
						resistance exercise. The importance of the combination may be
						further elevated in the aging person<br>
					</blockquote>

					<p>
						A study conducted on resistance-trained males already following a
						4-day weekly split intervened with both whey paired with casein
						(40g, 8g) and whey paired with additional <a

						against placebo (40g carbohydrate) and found that, over the course
						of 10 weeks and with an overall dietary intake of 2.1g/kg protein
						in the two protein groups, that whey plus casein was able to
						enhance lean mass gains over 5 weeks with no further effect over
						10 weeks relative to placebo.<sup><a href="#ref12">[12]</a></sup>
						The results of this study may have been influenced by less initial
						body weight in this group, which seemed to normalize.<sup><a
							href="#ref12">[12]</a></sup> In young untrained men, whey protein is
						significantly more effective than carbohydrate at inducing muscle
						protein synthesis and accumulating <a href="/topics/Lean+Mass/"
							rel="popover"
							data-content="Lean Mass is the overall body mass after Fat Mass has been subtracted.

						and type II fibers.<sup><a href="#ref11">[11]</a></sup>
						Consumption of fat-free milk (17.5g protein, 25.7g carbohydrate)
						has also been shown to increase lean mass over a period of 12
						weeks, and did so to a greater degree than soy protein when all
						subjects consumed 1.2-1.4g/kg protein before intervention<sup><a
							href="#ref186">[186]</a></sup> and in addition to an <em>ad
							libitum</em> (no dietary controls) diet.<sup><a href="#ref178">[178]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						Many studies do note that the addition of protein does not confer
						additional benefits, however, in both youth<sup><a
							href="#ref10">[10]</a></sup> and older subjects<sup><a
							href="#ref187">[187]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref188">[188]</a></sup>
						localizing protein intake around workouts. One study increasing
						protein intake from 1.4-1.8g/kg up to 2.16-2.28g/kg in highly
						trained athletes<sup><a href="#ref7">[7]</a></sup> found that the
						addition of 40g whey protein to elevate overall protein intake,
						regardless of timing, failed to induce changes in lean mass or fat
						mass over 12 weeks.
					</p>

					<p>
						Another study that found no effects of whey protein used 10, 20,
						or 30g taken twice daily in overweight and obese persons for 9
						months, and in conjunction with a thrice-weekly workout regimen (2
						weight training sessions, 1 aerobic) found no improvements on any
						metabolic parameter including body composition.<sup><a
							href="#ref189">[189]</a></sup> This study also experienced a 42%

					</p>

					<blockquote>
						The addition of protein to a diet does not inherently increase

						less promising results than those who underconsume protein (which
						tend to be studies done in the elderly, confounding the research
						for athletes quite a bit)<br>
					</blockquote>

					<p>
						Two studies have been conducted assessing at what point protein
						synthesis is maximized after resistance training when ingesting
						protein, one in youth<sup><a href="#ref185">[185]</a></sup> and
						one in older individuals.<sup><a href="#ref184">[184]</a></sup> In
						younger adults (n=6) with previous resistance training experience
						being tested with 5, 10, 20, and 40g egg proteins it was found
						that dose-response existed up until 20g protein for 4 hours post
						exercise, with no added benefit with 40g despite increasing
						circulating amino acids higher than 20g; this study was conducted
						with a diet of 1.4g/kg bodyweight and exercise was conducted in a
						fasted state.<sup><a href="#ref185">[185]</a></sup> When tested in
						older men (n=37) 20g of protein was again found to increase muscle
						protein synthesis, but when paired with resistance training
						exercise 40g appeared to be more effective in increasing muscle
						protein synthesis (95% more than baseline, relative to a 60%
						increase seen with 20g;<sup><a href="#ref184">[184]</a></sup> the
						youth experienced a 93% increase with 20g<sup><a
							href="#ref185">[185]</a></sup>). Interestingly, elderly persons are
						also more responsive to fast protein sources and acute spikes in
						amino acids relative to younger persons.<sup><a
							href="#ref190">[190]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						Maximal protein synthesis rates seem to be met at lower
						circulating amino acid levels in youth relative to elderly
						persons. Due to the protein synthesis rates being similar at 20g

					<h4>12.3. Nutrient Timing</h4>

						One study conducted in older persons (n=24) found that there was
						no significant difference in protein synthesis rates when
						comparing <a href="/supplements/Casein+Protein/" rel="popover"
							data-content="Out of the 'curds and the whey' of milk, Casein protein is the curds. A dietary protein source with gel-forming capabilities, it is touted to be slowly absorbed in part due to slowing intestinal motility (opioid agonism) and forming gels like fiber; adding water makes pudding"
							data-original-title="Casein Protein">casein</a> protein 30
						minutes before or after exercise (2 different groups) and whey
						after a workout when measured for 6.5 hours after exercise,
						although all three groups outperformed placebo.<sup><a
							href="#ref191">[191]</a></sup> This study used 15.6-30.4g protein
						(0.45g/kg lean body mass) and did note a higher C<sub>max</sub> of
						plasma leucine, insulin, and AA concentration with whey after
						about 2-3 hours.<sup><a href="#ref191">[191]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						When comparing protein sources against each other, in regards to
						consuming them near the workout, there may not be any significant
						difference between protein sources if looking at the entire day or
						a longer period of time. Whey protein may have higher protein
						synthesis rates if measured for the subsequent 2-3 hours after
						ingestion, however; other protein sources catch up<br>
					</blockquote>

					<p>
						One of the more well-conducted studies on the matter (10 weeks in
						duration, resistance trained young men, moderate to high level
						workout protocol) found that 42g whey protein (3.6g <a
							href="/supplements/Leucine/" rel="popover"
							data-content="Leucine is the main BCAA, and is the BCAA where most benefit is given to. Supplementing Leucine on its own is still beneficial and may be cheaper than BCAA mixes; they all still taste bitter, however"
							data-original-title="Leucine">Leucine</a>) given to 33 men either
						as a morning and night shake (2 shakes, group A) or a pre and post
						workout shake (2 shakes, group B) <sup><a href="#ref7">[7]</a></sup>
						found that both groups supplemented protein (and bringing total
						protein intake up to 31.5-31.6% from 20.8-23%; or 1.4-1.8g/kg up
						to 2.16-2.28g/kg) had an increase in bench press strength with no
						difference between protein groups, and no difference between the
						two protein groups and control in regards to squat strength
						increases or body composition.<sup><a href="#ref7">[7]</a></sup>
						The authors hypothesized that the lack of results were due to a
						plateau in protein-induced benefit at around 1.6g/kg in athletes.
						Similar results have been seen in a 16-week trial on diet induced
						weight loss in type II diabetics already placed on a high protein
						(33% of 6000-7000kJ, 1.2g/kg for obese persons) diet, where timing
						of a high protein snack (21g skim milk protein) prior to exercise
						relative to another time of day had no effect on body composition,
						energy expenditure, or all measured glycemic or lipid profiles
						(which all improved with weight loss).<sup><a href="#ref192">[192]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						Contrary to this, a 12-week resistance training program in
						previously sedentary elderly men (with a dietary intake of 1g/kg
						bodyweight protein before intervention) showed benefits on lean
						mass accrual when the protein supplement was consumed immediately
						after training (1.8 ± 0.7%) relative to 2 hours alter (1.5 ± 0.7%)
						as well as thigh circumference, with 1 rep max strength (but not 5
						rep max) strength also improving.<sup><a href="#ref193">[193]</a></sup>
						This study, however, used a skim milk/soybean blend at 10g protein
						(7g carb, 3.3g fats) and was the only source of nutrition for the
						2 hours after exercise.<sup><a href="#ref193">[193]</a></sup>
						Another study on sedentary older individuals (55-75) found that
						despite the same amount of protein ingestion per day over 3 days,
						timing 15.3g protein (milk protein, 4g of whey) after exercise
						(relative to carbohydrate) paired with a slightly caloric increase
						in both groups led to a 57% greater protein accumulation in the
						group that consumed protein after exercise.<sup><a
							href="#ref194">[194]</a></sup> This study used a lead-in diet of 15%
						protein (30% fat, 55% carbs), and is a low overall intake.
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						The benefit of whey protein being timed around workouts <em>may</em>
						be dependent on low dietary intake of protein, with more efficient
						protein utilization occurring near a workout; these benefits may
						be 'washed away' by overconsuming protein, making the importance
						of timing inversely related to overall dietary protein intake. The
						notion that nutrient timing may be relevant to older individuals
						is also possible<br>
					</blockquote>

					<p>
						One study on 6 healthy and untrained volunteers, an essential
						amino acid (EAA) solution of 6g taken alongside 35g carbohydrate
						in a fasted state was significantly more effective in improving
						muscle protein synthesis (as measured by phenylalanine
						incorporation) when taken immediately before when compared to
						immediately after.<sup><a href="#ref195">[195]</a></sup> This
						study did not note any differences in workload, blood flow, or
						amino acid levels in the blood aside from timing.<sup><a
							href="#ref195">[195]</a></sup> Another study using the same
						formulation, sample size, and in a fasted state but comparing 1
						hour after against 3 hours after noted that no significant
						differences existed in insulin secretion, glucose uptake, or
						overall protein synthesis or breakdown up to 4 hours after
						intervention<sup><a href="#ref196">[196]</a></sup> while another
						comparing immediately after and 3 hours after (exercise in a
						fasted state) using 10g protein, 8g carbohydrate, 3g fats found a
						12% increase in muscle protein synthesis above baseline values in
						the 3-hour group yet a three-fold increase in the group consuming
						the drink immediately after cycling exercise.<sup><a
							href="#ref197">[197]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						Pre-loading some protein, if in a fasted state, may be better than
						consuming it after a workout with little to no pertinent need to
						consume the protein immediately after the workout. The 'one hour
						metabolic window' may apply only to fasted training where there is
						no pre-load, as some evidence suggests that sooner is better in
						this particular scenario only<br>

					<h4>12.4. Muscle Damage and Recovery</h4>
					<p></p>

					<p>
						Whey protein, and protein in general, may enhance recovery rates
						from exercise. In studies that induce muscular damage with weight
						training and subject participants to a form of protein or nothing,
						studies that ingest protein tend to recovery strength faster at
						subsequent workouts.<sup><a href="#ref187">[187]</a></sup><sup><a
							href="#ref198">[198]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref199">[199]</a></sup>
						When measured 6 hours after the first bout, the hydrolysate form
						of protein appears to be effective while Whey Isolate is not
						(previous studies done on subsequent days).<sup><a
							href="#ref80">[80]</a></sup> The addition of amino acids or protein to
						an intentionally high volume workout plan can increase the amount
						of workload done over time.<sup><a href="#ref200">[200]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						In studies that measure delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), no
						significant effects are seen between carbohydrate,<sup><a
							href="#ref199">[199]</a></sup> milk, or a combination of the two<sup><a
							href="#ref187">[187]</a></sup> no significant differences between
						water, whey isolate, and whey hydrolysate when measured 6 hours
						later,<sup><a href="#ref80">[80]</a></sup> The studies that do
						note less DOMS are those that have protein consumed 30 minutes
						before exercise, suggesting pre-loading may be of importance;<sup><a

					<p>
						After consumption of 55g whey protein (in two doses of 27.5g with

						protein (30.9+/-0.5 versus 32.5+/-0.4) and free T4 was lower in
						whey (13.7+/-0.1pmol/L) than in soy (14.5+/-0.3pmol/L), although
						this study noted weight loss with the Whey group (2.8kg over 23
						weeks).<sup><a href="#ref14">[14]</a></sup> Thyroid hormones tend
						to increase more in general when dietary protein increases
						(relative to carbohydrate<sup><a href="#ref14">[14]</a></sup><sup><a

					<h4>13.3. Appetite</h4>
					<p></p>

					<p>
						Due to whey protein's satiety value (ability to induce the
						sensation of fullness), it can reduce body fat over time through
						reduced overall food consumption.<sup><a href="#ref207">[207]</a></sup>
						Glycomacropeptide and CCK influence this a bit, but it seems to
						have subtle influences rather than potent appetite suppression.<sup><a

					</p>

					<p>
						There is mixed human data on whether a pre-load of whey protein
						suppresses appetite in subsequent meals, one study found 20g whey
						administered 30min before food did not have an effect while <a

							href="#ref210">[210]</a></sup> whereas another study found the opposite
						effects with the same dose and timing (although it noted that
						hydroslates rather than concentrates did not have this suppression
						of appetite).<sup><a href="#ref211">[211]</a></sup> Increasing the
						time between the pre-load and meal seems to reduce any potential
						appetite suppression<sup><a href="#ref212">[212]</a></sup> and in
						this regard there appears to be a 'more-is-better' relationship<sup><a
							href="#ref211">[211]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref213">[213]</a></sup> as

					<h4>13.4. Interventions</h4>
					<p></p>

					<p>
						One intervention of 138 subjects given either 10g whey protein or
						10g glucose over 12 weeks found that a 500kcal deficit was able to
						induce weight loss in both groups, but those consuming whey had
						6.1% body fat loss compared to 5% in the glucose control; this
						study used an American Heart Association style diet (15% protein
						and 55% carbohydrates) and had funding from the company providing
						the protein.<sup><a href="#ref20">[20]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						One study comparing 52g whey protein isolate against soy and
						carbohydrate (2 different groups) found that, despite keeping
						calories static, whey protein outperformed soy protein and glucose
						control at reducing fat mass when combined with a caloric deficit
						(0.9kg more than soy and 1.8kg more than glucose over 23 weeks).<sup><a
							href="#ref14">[14]</a></sup> The protein groups averaged 1.4g/kg
						bodyweight while the glucose control had 0.8g/kg protein
						consumption, and this study may be influenced by a reduction in
						carbohydrates seen in the whey protein group that reached
						significance.<sup><a href="#ref14">[14]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						Conversely, studies that do not find reductions in body weight
						exist. One intervention used whey against glucose and casein
						control groups in overweight/obese persons for 12 weeks and found
						improvements in cardiovascular health biomarkers (blood pressure)
						yet no significant weight loss.<sup><a href="#ref106">[106]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						Whey protein does not seem to <em>induce</em> fat loss when the
						diet is not controlled, and may not influence fat loss when

						A fair amount of benefits associated with <em>Whey Protein</em>

						stimulate muscle protein synthesis are either feeding or
						resistance exercise<sup><a href="#ref214">[214]</a></sup> of which
						the latter is defined by increases in circulating amino acids<sup><a

						spike much more rapidly than casein protein despite no differences
						in overall exposure (as assessed by AUC).<sup><a
							href="#ref219">[219]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref220">[220]</a></sup>
						Despite this increased C<sub>max</sub> of amino acids and higher
						peak of protein synthesis, studies are highly mixed when comparing
						whey against casein. Whey appears to effectively increase protein
						synthesis more in older individuals compared to casein,<sup><a
							href="#ref191">[191]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref190">[190]</a></sup>
						while in youth casein seems to cause slightly more overall
						nitrogen retention on the body.<sup><a href="#ref220">[220]</a></sup>
						At least one study notes the most benefit with a combination,
						although this study used 40g whey to 8g casein (somewhat reverse
						of the ratio found in Milk).<sup><a href="#ref12">[12]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						In a study on COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease),
						characterized by disturbed amino acid metabolism, casein appears
						better than whey at inducing protein retention and possibly
						building muscle mass (study was too short to conclude the latter
						statement).<sup><a href="#ref221">[221]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						To make a general statement on the comparison, it seems that most
						benefits associated with either Whey or Casein are due to them
						inherently being protein. Whey might benefit the elderly more than
						Casein, and vice-versa for youth. The degree that one is better
						than the other (in regards to protein synthesis) is minimal
						relative to the degree they are both better than a protein
						deficient diet<br>
					</blockquote>

					<p>
						Against casein (as sodium caseinate) Whey protein seems better
						able to reduce spikes in Triglycerides seen after meals with fatty
						acids in them<sup><a href="#ref108">[108]</a></sup> and can reduce
						triglycerides over a period of 6 weeks; outperforming casein but
						not reaching statistical significance in doing so.<sup><a
							href="#ref13">[13]</a></sup> When paired against casein, whey protein
						seems to be better at reducing LDL cholesterol and Total
						cholesterol over a period of 6 weeks, and appears to more
						favorably influence insulin sensitivity and insulin AUC compared
						to casein.<sup><a href="#ref13">[13]</a></sup> One study in rats
						failed to replicate the reduction in triglycerides with 100% of
						the diet as whey relative to a group with all casein, but
						demonstrated an increase in HDL-C over casein.<sup><a
							href="#ref222">[222]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						One study in rats found a significantly higher fasting glucose
						level relative to both casein and a 30/70 whey/casein blend, when
						they were the exclusive protein sources in the diet.<sup><a
							href="#ref222">[222]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						When measuring anti-oxidative abilities (in a clinical setting),
						whey protein confered greater anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory
						effects as assessed by glutathione and IL-6; respectively.<sup><a

						the increased anti-cancer potential (via killing tumors) as native
						a-lactalbumin does not inherently attack tumors.<sup><a
							href="#ref236">[236]</a></sup> It was first discovered in 1995<sup><a
							href="#ref237">[237]</a></sup> and intentionally created in 2000
						through an ion-exchange procedure in a medium with oleic acid<sup><a
							href="#ref238">[238]</a></sup> and now has additional preparation
						methods.<sup><a href="#ref239">[239]</a></sup> Beyond cancer
						cells, HAMLET appears to have potency in killing the bacteria <em>Streptococcus
							pneumoniae</em>.<sup><a href="#ref240">[240]</a></sup><sup><a
							href="#ref238">[238]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref241">[241]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						HAMLET is the most well researched, but Oleic Acid has been shown
						to form complexes with bovine ß-lactalbumin (component of Whey
						Protein)<sup><a href="#ref242">[242]</a></sup> where binding of
						oleic acid induced thermal stabilization of ß-lactalbumin and was
						as effective as HAMLET in inducing cell death in HEp-2 cells.<sup><a
							href="#ref242">[242]</a></sup> Additionally, a-lactalbumin that is
						derived from cows milk (Bovine a-lactalbumin) is referred to as
						BAMLET.<sup><a href="#ref243">[243]</a></sup> BAMLET and other
						variants of HAMLET such as the aforementioned complex of oleic
						acid and ß-lactalbumin have comparable cytotoxicity to cancer
						cells.<sup><a href="#ref244">[244]</a></sup><sup><a
							href="#ref245">[245]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						One study investigating the effects of heat treatment noted that
						unfolding of the protein (denaturation) caused an enhanced
						subsequent production of BAMLET <em>in vitro</em>, but eventually
						the heat could cumulatively degrade the a-lactalbumin precursor
						and hinder BAMLET production.<sup><a href="#ref243">[243]</a></sup>
						These results contrast earlier hypothesis' that changes to protein
						confirmation could abolish the effects of HAMLET/BAMLET.<sup><a
							href="#ref246">[246]</a></sup> One the complex itself is formed, it has
						either equal to or lesser stability than the protein it was formed
						from; with one study noting that HAMLET was denatured at 15°C less
						than a-lactalbumin.<sup><a href="#ref247">[247]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						A promising anti-cancer complex of whey protein and olive oil
						components; no <em>in vivo</em> studies currently exist so beyond
						noting its potential no conclusions can be made as to efficacy or
						whether it can be digested or formed <em>in vivo</em> after

					<h4>17.1. Pregnancy</h4>
					<p></p>

					<p>
						Whey is already a component of human breast milk,<sup><a
							href="#ref248">[248]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref249">[249]</a></sup> as
						are many of its bioactive peptides such as alpha-lactalbumin,
						which is seen as good for infant nutrition.<sup><a
							href="#ref36">[36]</a></sup> Beyond that, whey is commonly added to
						infant formulaes due to its benefits associated with infant health
						(although usually in a hydrolyzed form, which might reduces the
						allergic potential yet has not been shown to have benefits over
						breast milk<sup><a href="#ref250">[250]</a></sup>).
					</p>

					<p>
						No human evidence exists directly assessing whether or not whey
						consumption <em>per se</em> is good or bad for infant health when
						consumed by a mother during pregnancy or lactation; one study in
						mice found that general overconsumption of protein (40% of the
						diet by calories) during pregnancy could slightly reduce birth
						weight of the pups, and during lactation it reduced the mRNA of
						bioactive proteins in the breast.<sup><a href="#ref251">[251]</a></sup>
					</p>

					<blockquote>No compelling evidence to discourage usage
						in pregnancy, and whey as a naturally component of cheese and milk
						(consumed routinely during pregnancy) suggests moderate usage of
						whey protein is fine. Mothers should be aware of possible
						contaminants in poor brands of whey protein which has been
						reported in the media previously, although is seen as uncommon</blockquote>

								data-content="Out of the 'curds and the whey' of milk, Casein protein is the curds. A dietary protein source with gel-forming capabilities, it is touted to be slowly absorbed in part due to slowing intestinal motility (opioid agonism) and forming gels like fiber; adding water makes pudding"
								data-original-title="Casein Protein">Casein</a>. Due to a high
							Cysteine component, Whey may be healthier than other forms of
							protein, although most benefits associated with Whey are due to
							protein itself, and casein may be a better muscle builder.
