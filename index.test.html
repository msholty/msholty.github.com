						Whey protein is one of the two proteins found in Milk, with the
						other being <a href="/supplements/Casein+Protein/" rel="popover"
							data-content="Out of the 'curds and the whey' of milk, Casein protein is the curds. A dietary protein source with gel-forming capabilities, it is touted to be slowly absorbed in part due to slowing intestinal motility (opioid agonism) and forming gels like fiber; adding water makes pudding"
							data-original-title="Casein Protein">casein</a>. When a coagulant
						(usually renin) is added to milk, the curds and the wheys form
						(solid and liquids) with the curds being casein and the wheys
						being whey. Whey protein is the water-soluble portion of milk, and
						is comprised of various water-soluble amino acids and protein
						structures as well as anything else lost in this portion.
					</p>

					<p>Although many benefits associated with Whey protein are due
						to it being a protein itself (and thus could be extended to many
						protein sources), Whey appears unique in the sense that it
						delivers a large amount of the amino acid L-Cysteine. A
						subclinical deficiency state of L-Cysteine may exist during aging
						and diabetes (as well as some other conditions) that can be
						alleviated with additional dietary L-Cysteine; either a surplus of
						protein in general or more efficiently through Whey protein due to
						more Cysteine per gram of protein.</p>

					<p>Whey is touted at being faster absorbed than other forms of
						protein, and this is demonstrably true. However, this increased
						speed does not seem to transfer well to increased Muscle Protein
						Synthesis when the body is already in a fed state. Whey may be
						better than other protein sources at inducing protein synthesis in
						a fasted state (first meal of the day), but does not seem to be
						significantly better when protein is added to a long-term exercise
						regimen. Beyond breaking a fasted state, preferably when exercise
						was also done, the increased speed of whey protein does not appear
						to confer much practical benefit (despite theoretically being able
						to).</p>

					<p>
						Whey is also touted to increase fat loss, but this appears to be a
						function of protein <em>per se</em> rather than whey and is not
						like a classical fat loss agent (Whey can make fat loss go more
						smoothly, but does not inherently reduce fat; requiring a caloric
						deficit). The efficiency aspect of whey does play a role, with
						Whey being a better protein choice for preserving <a

						intakes, other sources such as soy seem equally effective as whey

					<p>Like all other protein sources, whey does not inherently
						harm the liver or kidneys, but it can exacerbate pre-existing
						damage. Persons with harmed livers or kidneys (disease states or
						otherwise) should exercise caution in increasing protein intake
						too quickly and without the guidance of a medical doctor.</p>
